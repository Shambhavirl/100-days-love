  "0": "Day 1: I really like your laugh, have I ever told you that? Probably have. I've fallen for your laugh, which is utterly contagious. I have also fallen for your smile which makes me giddy for no reason at all (or a lot actually). I've fallen for your silly and TOTALLY ORIGINAL jokes, which I remember randomly and just smile or burst into laughter at. I've fallen for how you make my day better, even if I wanted to cry a minute before. I've also fallen for every second I get to spend with you even if those leave me wanting more. Every moment with you feels like the sweetest story, and I canâ€™t wait for all the chapters weâ€™ll write together. ðŸ’–"
